<div class="afterthought">He had never heard screams like it before, and he stood paralyzed as the sound-and the sight of her constricted, broken face— dinned at him, numbing him. These are psychotic screams, he said to himself. From the racial unconscious. not from a person but from a deeper level; from a collective entity.</div>
<div class="finishing">Knowing that did not help.</div>

        “He’s a lousy waiter,” he said, “and this is a lousy restaurant. Let’s get out of here.”<br>
        Kathy said bitterly, “So that’s what it means to be a celebrity. I understand.” She quietly put down her fork.</div>
